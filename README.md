⚠️
- Reminder: if you don't KYC through zkPass, running the bot is useless. 
- Those wallets are only used for fauceting and then transferring to the main wallet (but doing it this way makes it easy to get sybil attacks). 
- In summary, if you have experience, play by yourself, if you want safety, besides sending to your main wallet,
- you should also send to the developer's wallet (around 5 wallets)
